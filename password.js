/*Create a new file called password.js. Write a program that does the following:

Create a variable called password and set itâ€™s value to a string of your choice.

Write a conditional statement that checks if the password meets the following constraints:

At least 10 characters long

Contains at least one letter and one number

If the password meets the constraint, console log a success message.

If the password fails the constraint, console log a failure message.

Test out your conditional by changing the value of your password variable and running your file!
